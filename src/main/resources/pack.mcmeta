        "_comment": "A pack_format of 5 requires json lang files and some texture changes from 1.15 to 1.15.1. A pack_format of 4 requires json lang files and should be used with Minecraft 1.13 to Minecraft 1.14.4. A pack_format of 3 should be used starting with Minecraft 1.11 to Minecraft 1.12.2. All resources, including language files, should be lowercase (eg: en_us.lang). A pack_format of 2 will load your mod resources with LegacyV2Adapter, which requires language files to have uppercase letters (eg: en_US.lang)."
