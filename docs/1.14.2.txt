Changes compared to 1.14.1:
- Protocol version updated 480 -> 485
- Changes to ClientPlayerEntity.isInSneakingPose and tickMovement
- Change to handling of SChunkDataPacket when isFullChunk is false (probably don't want to implement this)
- Possibility of bugged double merchant sounds with this bridge?
